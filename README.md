# Request Header Parser Microservice

This is the Request Header Parser Microservice project, part of the FreeCodeCamp (FCC) curriculum. This project is designed to help me learn how to create a microservice that parses HTTP request headers and returns useful information.

## Overview

In this project, I built a microservice that extracts information from the request headers of incoming HTTP requests. The microservice returns a JSON response containing the client's IP address and preferred languages.

## Project Link

Instructions for building this project can be found at [FreeCodeCamp - Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/request-header-parser-microservice)

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Set up a Node.js and Express server.
- Access and parse HTTP request headers.
- Return a JSON response containing the parsed information.

## Endpoint

- `GET /api/whoami`
  - This endpoint returns a JSON object with the client's IP address, and preferred languages
  
### Technology Stack
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- JavaScript: The programming language used for building the server-side logic.
